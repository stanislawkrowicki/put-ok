The project explores a variation of the classic Chinese Postman Problem, where the postman must visit every street in the city at least once, optimizing the route to minimize the total distance. In this version, the postman has an additional ability to travel back in time to a previously visited point, but with a limited number of such returns. This constraint requires developing a strategy to optimize the use of this feature to further shorten the route.\hypertarget{md__home_staszek_put_sem3_put_ok_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Sources\+:}\label{md__home_staszek_put_sem3_put_ok_README_autotoc_md1}
